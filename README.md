Excel VBA animation simulating a logistics flow using Shapes
# Excel VBA Shapes Animation

This project simulates a logistics/industrial flow using Excel VBA and Shapes.

## Features
- Shape-based animation (tractors, wagons, gantry cranes)
- Movement controlled via VBA (Top / Left positions)
- Sequential and simultaneous operations
- No timers, no external libraries

## Problem
The animation works correctly for one full cycle, but breaks when trying to repeat the same logic in a loop.

## Goal
Find a clean and safe way to repeat a working animation block in VBA.

## Files
- `.bas` files: exported VBA modules
- Screenshots: visual reference of the flow
